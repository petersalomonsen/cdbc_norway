# Purpose

CDBC creates opportunities to accelerate, open up and be more inclusive in our economic system. We can reduce obstacles and complexity when it comes to paying for consumption or getting paid for providing, by applying technology to automate settlements and reporting on a national and also international scale.

- Credit: collateral, terms, guarantors, collection handled by smart contracts
- Banking: Interbank settlements, more inclusive banking
- International development funding: Pin-pointing and following the monetary flow

- Asset ownership and transfers: settlement and record of ownership change
- Financial crime: Provide a platform for surveilling money and asset transfers
- Privacy: Establish standards for ensuring disclosure of sensitive information only to authorized parties

Thoughts on Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC) in Norway
==========================================================

# Purpose

CDBC creates opportunities to accelerate, open up and be more inclusive in our economic system. We can reduce obstacles and complexity when it comes to paying for consumption or getting paid for providing, by applying technology to automate settlements and reporting on a national and also international scale.

## Examples of areas to improve

- Tax reporting and collection: smart contracts can automatically deduct taxes in the same moment as a transaction takes place
- Payments: International standardized digital payments solutions
- Credit: collateral, terms, guarantors, collection handled by smart contracts
- Banking: Interbank settlements, more inclusive banking
- International development funding: Pin-pointing and following the monetary flow
- Small business establishment: accounting, bureaucracy, payment services
- Asset ownership and transfers: settlement and record of ownership change
- Financial crime: Provide a platform for surveilling money and asset transfers
- Privacy: Establish standards for ensuring disclosure of sensitive information only to authorized parties
  
# Technological solution

- The technological solution must also encourage participation
  - Blockchain technology/cryptocurrencies are examples generating incentives for such contribution: both for operation, maintenance and evolution

- Interoptability across blockchains
  - Other central banks
  - Fully decentralized blockchains
